# Chapter 1: Introduction

## Objectives of this chapter
- How is a computer system organized?
- What is the point of interrupts?
- What components is a modern multiprocessor computer system composed of?
- What is user mode?
- What is kernel mode?
- Can you illustrate the transition between user mode and kernel mode?
- How are operating systems used in different computing environments?
- Can you name examples of free and open source operating systems?

## Chapter 1.1: What operating systems do

- An operating system is software that manages a computer's hardware

- Computer systems are divided into 4 components:
    - Hardware
    - Application programs
    - Operating system
    - A user

- A computer's hardware provides resources that the operating system will manage

- A computer's hardware is made out of:
    - Memory
    - CPU (Central processing Unit)
    - I/O (Input/Output) devices

- Application programs are software that require resources from the computer's hardware to carry out their duty

    <div> An OS is composed of:</div>
        <ul>
            <li>A kernel that is loaded at boot time (when the computer turns on)</li>
            <li>Device drivers and kernel functions that are loaded at runtime</li>
            <li>System programs related to the kernel</li>
        </ul>
