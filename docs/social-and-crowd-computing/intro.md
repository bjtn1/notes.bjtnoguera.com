## Today's topic

### The Strength of Weak Ties

Ties = how connected a group or individual is to a community/group/individual/idea/etc

Some brother from John Hopkins claimed this abotu weak ties:
- They allow you to maintain connections with new peeps
- Say you're looking for a new company job, your weak ties from company X will aid you in landing a job in company X.

The butterfly effect:
- Bro we've all played that one game with the high schoolers and the killer picture teacher LMAO

Something similar to this is the Chaos Theory and the Black Swan Effect

Dunbar's number says:
- You cannot have and mantain (on avg) more than 150 strong connections
